# Week 1 – Python Basics: Statcast Mini-Assignment

**Goal:** Refresh Python + Pandas by exploring Statcast data for a single hitter or pitcher.

## Tasks

1. Load a Statcast CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Compute:
   - Average exit velocity
   - Hard-hit percentage (balls hit 95+ mph)
   - Launch angle distribution (mean, median, standard deviation)
3. Create a scatterplot of launch angle vs. exit velocity.
4. Write a short summary of the player’s batted-ball profile in a markdown cell in your notebook.
